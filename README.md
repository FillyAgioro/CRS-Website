# Computer Repair Service Website

![Website Screenshot](dist/img/screenshot.png)

This is template of Computer Repair Service website. I made this for easy to build website for people who just want to build simple website without any advance coding knowledge. This is simple easy and user friendly website with only html and css(you can also try SASS if you know that).

## 🏃️ Getting Started

- You just need to edit [`index.html`](index.html) file.
- For more harder customization you can edit the [`style.css`](dist/style.css).
- All the logo and image are in [`dist`](dist) folder.
- If you want your website app icon work properly in webapp then edit [`manifest`](manifest.json) file.
- **Note:** If you have knowledge of `SASS` you can also edit [`style.scss`](style.scss) file.
